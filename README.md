# Tech Pirates Versathon - Fintech Login System

This project implements a fully functional login and signup flow with a fintech theme.

## Features

- **Login Page**: Email/Password login and Google Login simulation.
- **Signup Page**: Account creation with email/password and Google Signup simulation.
- **Profile Setup**: A dedicated page for new users to set their username.
- **Dashboard**: A simple landing page after successful login/signup.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop.
- **Fintech Theme**: Professional blue and white color scheme.

## How to Run

1. Open `login.html` in your web browser.
2. You can try logging in with any email (simulation).
3. Or click "Sign Up" to create a new account.
4. Or use the "Continue with Google" button.
5. After login/signup, you will be directed to the Profile Setup page if it's your first time (simulated logic based on LocalStorage).
6. Once your username is set, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
